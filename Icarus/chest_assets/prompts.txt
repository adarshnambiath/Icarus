the icarus who has fallen
the one who is an icarus anew
has loved a star that is brighter than usual
a star that shines just like every other star
a star can blind you when it gets too close
The star had fallen
he has fallen gracefully and at will
Unlike icarus who was ripped of his wings
together they stayed and together they grew
Icarus and his star had started anew
A star has to prioritize light over love
It happened once when his sun chose to shine
it knew that it would melt off icarus's wings
And it happened again with his star
As his star starts to lose his light
go home and see to it that the light doesn't go off
The star said as he prepares himself
You're leaving me, said Icarus
Blinded by his needs and his selfishness
It's not like that my love
I cannot lose myself for you 
the star had said through his tears
He saw icarus was not hearing him
That was the last that icarus heard of his star
Now he wears his heart in his sleeves 
his stars heart around his neck
And now the icarus you know, who has fallen
he loved a star that is brighter than usual
And loves him still, but on a brighter point of view
